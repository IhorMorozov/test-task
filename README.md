# UI requirements:

### General
- [x] Create application with 2 tabs

### Tabs structure
- [x] Profiles tab: show a grid. It must have columns like “Profile name”, “Profile status”, “Creation date”, and other as you wish. All your available data should be saved to the DB (WebSQL)
- [x] Summary tab: should display profile’s data in any format/design you wish.

### Grid columns
- [x] Add one or few columns with image and tooltip on hover
- [x] Add some progress column, and present inside simple progress line
- [x] Grid should have at least 1 column with date format. It should be presented like dd/mm/YYYY
- [x] Add one or few columns with percentage format
- [x] Add one or few columns with currency format (with $)
- [x] Profile name should be a link. On click -> redirect to the summary tab, and display all selected profile’s data. Use routing for navigationing.

### Sorting
- [x] Each column should be sortable (by clicking on the column name)

### Column Selection 
- [x] In the actions bar you should add a button “Column selection”. On click you need to open a new popup/dialog, and you should be able to select columns to display in the grid. After changes will be applied, the grid should be reloaded with appropriate columns.
